# Drawing with Fourier Transform

Everything in the world can be described as a waveform, a function of time or space. For example, a sound wave, the electromagnetic field, the price of a stock etc. The Fourier Transform gives us a new perspective in viewing these waveforms and functions.
All waveforms, no matter what you scribble or observe in the universe, are actually just the sum of simple sinusoids of different frequencies.

## Notes
Project made in Processing which is a tool that lets you use programming to sketch on the screen. Premade video outputs are included.
The python file is a simple demonstration of the fourier transform which seperates signals into different sinusoid functions.
